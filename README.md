# Online-Payments-Fraud-Detection-with-Machine-Learning
This project demonstrates the development of a Machine Learning model to detect fraudulent online payment transactions. Using a real-world dataset of financial transactions, we train a Decision Tree Classifier to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activity. This has vital applications in the finance and cybersecurity sectors.
